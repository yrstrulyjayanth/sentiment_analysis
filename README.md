# Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews project! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to analyze and classify the sentiment of restaurant reviews. The primary goal is to determine whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights for restaurant management and potential customers.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model that can process restaurant reviews and categorize them based on their sentiment. By analyzing customer feedback, restaurant owners can gain insights into customer satisfaction and areas for improvement.

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classify reviews as "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral."
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilize a pre-trained model for quick sentiment analysis.
- **Custom Training**: Train the model on your own dataset for customized results.
- **Visualization**: Includes tools for visualizing sentiment distribution and review trends.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy
- Other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-restaurant-reviews.git
    cd sentiment-analysis-restaurant-reviews
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

#### Analyzing Reviews with the Pre-trained Model

To classify a review using the pre-trained model, run:

```bash
python predict.py --review "The food was amazing and the service was excellent!"
```

Replace `"The food was amazing and the service was excellent!"` with the review text you want to analyze.

#### Training the Model

To train the model with your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format with columns for `review` and `sentiment`:

    ```csv
    review,sentiment
    "The food was amazing and the service was excellent!",Positive
    "I had a terrible experience and the food was cold.",Negative
    ```

2. Run the training script:

    ```bash
    python train.py --data-file path/to/dataset.csv
    ```

This will train the model and save the weights to `model_weights.h5`.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on a test dataset, use:

```bash
python evaluate.py --data-file path/to/test-dataset.csv
```

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy]% on the test set. For detailed performance metrics, refer to the `evaluation_report.md` file.

## Visualization

Visualize sentiment distribution and review trends using:

```bash
python visualize.py --data-file path/to/review-data.csv
```

This will generate plots and charts showing the sentiment distribution across reviews.
